# AI Drone Bootcamp 🚁🤖

Welcome to my **AI-Drone Bootcamp** project!  
This repository documents my journey of building an **AI-powered drone simulation** that can detect colors, process images, and eventually navigate in ROS2 + Gazebo environments.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **00-roadmap.md** → My learning and project roadmap  
- **01-python-basics/** → Python basics (variables, lists, functions)  
- **04-cv-opencv/** → Computer Vision with OpenCV  
  - `color_detect.py` → Simple color detection  
  - `color_detect_v2.py` → Advanced color detection (HSV presets + mask filtering)  
- **06-ros2-basics/** → ROS2 basic concepts and notes  
- **07-gazebo-worlds/** → Gazebo simulation environment setup

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen **Python** and **Computer Vision** fundamentals  
- Learn **ROS2** basics  
- Set up a **Gazebo simulation** environment  
- Develop an **autonomous drone project** as part of my graduation thesis
